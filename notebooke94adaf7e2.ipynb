With growing digital media and ever growing publishing – who has the time to go through entire articles / documents / books to decide whether they are useful or not? Thankfully – this technology is already here.\n","\n","Have you come across the mobile app inshorts? It’s an innovative news app that converts news articles into a 60-word summary. And that is exactly what we are going to learn in this article — Automatic Text Summarization.\n","\n","Automatic Text Summarization is one of the most challenging and interesting problems in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is a process of generating a concise and meaningful summary of text from multiple text resources such as books, news articles, blog posts, research papers, emails, and tweets.\n","\n","The demand for automatic text summarization systems is spiking these days thanks to the availability of large amounts of textual data.\n","\n","Through this article, we will explore the realms of text summarization. We will understand how the TextRank algorithm works, and will also implement it in Python. Strap in, this is going to be a fun ride!\n","\n","## Understanding the TextRank Algorithm\n","\n","Before getting started with the TextRank algorithm, there’s another algorithm which we should become familiar with – the PageRank algorithm. In fact, this actually inspired TextRank! PageRank is used primarily for ranking web pages in online search results. Let’s quickly understand the basics of this algorithm with the help of an example.\n","\n","![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pagerank11.png)\n","\n","\n","## TextRank Algorithm\n","\n","Let’s understand the TextRank algorithm, now that we have a grasp on PageRank. I have listed the similarities between these two algorithms below:\n","\n","In place of web pages, we use sentences\n","Similarity between any two sentences is used as an equivalent to the web page transition probability\n","The similarity scores are stored in a square matrix, similar to the matrix M used for PageRank\n","TextRank is an extractive and unsupervised text summarization technique. Let’s take a look at the flow of the TextRank algorithm that we will be following:\n","\n","![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/block_3.png)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","
